    <p style="text-align: center;">Just a few months ago we were living a completely different life unaware of how rapidly things were going to change. The Coronavirus is a global disturbance that has forced us all to come together and try to put an end to it. While we are all making changes and doing what we can to help, there is still a lot more that needs to be done. Weâ€™ve seen some apps and websites pop up to try and provide information to help fight this COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic.</p>
    
    <h2>What Is COVID-19?</h2>
    <p>A <a href="https://www.webmd.com/lung/coronavirus">coronavirus</a>  is a kind of common virus that causes an infection in your nose, sinuses, or upper throat. Most coronaviruses aren't dangerous.In early 2020, after a December 2019 outbreak in China, the World Health Organization identified SARS-CoV-2 as a new type of coronavirus. The outbreak quickly spread around the world.
<mark>COVID-19 is a disease caused by SARS-CoV-2</mark> that can trigger what doctors call a respiratory tract infection. It can affect your upper respiratory tract (sinuses, nose, and throat) or lower respiratory tract (windpipe and lungs).<br>
It spreads the same way other coronaviruses do, mainly through person-to-person contact. Infections range from mild to deadly.
